# Pentago
The game of Pentago, for CM4043

# Instructions
To run the game, just do:
```
    python main.py
```
You may want to test all functions by running, which executes a suite of test cases
(although not using python's unittest module, which is a TODO)
```
    python test_all_funcs.py
```
# Requirements
Nothing fancy. This project uses numpy, typing, math, random & tqdm, all of which should already come with your Python installation.
Tested on Python 3.7
